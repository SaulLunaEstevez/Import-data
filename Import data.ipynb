allows again,\\r\\n  Meetings, greetings, and voices\\r\\n    Of women talking with men.\\r\\n\\r\\n  So we return to our places,\\r\\n    As out on the bridge she rolls;\\r\\n  And the darkness covers our faces,\\r\\n    And the darkness re-enters our souls.\\r\\n\\r\\n  More than a little lonely\\r\\n    Where the lessening tail-lights shine.\\r\\n  No--not combatants--only\\r\\n    Details

Heaven.\\r\\n  We made an Army in our own image, on an island nine by seven,\\r\\n  Which faithfully mirrored its makers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ideals, equipment, and mental\\r\\n     attitude--\\r\\n  And so we got our lesson: and we ought to accept it with gratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n  We have spent two hundred million pounds to prove the fact once more,\\r\\n  That horses are quicker than men afoot, since two and two make four:\\r\\n  And horses have four legs, and men have two legs, and two into four\\r\\n     goes twice,\\r\\n  And nothing over except our lesson--and very cheap at the price.\\r\\n\\r\\n  For remember (this our children shall know: we are too near for that\\r\\n     knowledge)\\r\\n  Not our mere astonied camps, but Council and Creed and College--\\r\\n  All the obese, unchallenged old things that stifle and overlie us--\\r\\n  Have felt the effects of the lesson we got--an advantage no money\\r\\n     could buy us!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Then let us develop this marvellous asset which we alone command,\\r\\n  And which, it may subsequently transpire, will be worth as much as\\r\\n     the Rand:\\r\\n  Let us approach this pivotal fact in a humble yet hopeful mood--\\r\\n  We have had no end of a lesson: it will do us no end of good!\\r\\n\\r\\n  It was our fault, and our very great fault--and now we must turn it\\r\\n     to use;\\r\\n  We have forty million reasons for failure, but not a single excuse!\\r\\n  So the more we work and the less we talk the better results we shall\\r\\n     get--\\r\\n  We have had an Imperial lesson; it may make us an Empire yet!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FILES  [Page 17]\\r\\n\\r\\n(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Files--\\r\\n  The Files--\\r\\n  Office Files!\\r\\n  Oblige me by referring to the

fear--\\r\\n  Bringing the word well smoothen--such as a King should hear._\\r\\n\\r\\n  Fenced by your careful fathers, ringed by your leaden seas,\\r\\n  Long did ye wake in quiet and long lie down at ease;\\r\\n  Till ye said of Strife, \\xe2\\x80\\x98What is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the Sword, \\xe2\\x80\\x98It is far from\\r\\n     our ken\\xe2\\x80\\x99;\\r\\n  Till ye made a sport of your shrunken hosts and a toy of your armed\\r\\n     men.\\r\\n  Ye stopped your ears to the warning--ye would neither look nor heed--\\r\\n  Ye set your leisure before their toil and your lusts above their\\r\\n     need.\\r\\n  Because of your witless learning and your beasts of warren and chase,\\r\\n  Ye grudged your sons to their service and your fields for their\\r\\n     camping-place.\\r\\n  Ye forced them glean in the highways the straw for the bricks they\\r\\n     brought;\\r\\n  Ye forced them follow in byways the craft that ye never taught.\\r\\n  Ye hindered and hampered and crippled; ye thrust out of sight and\\r\\n     away\\r\\n  Those that would serve you for honour and those that served you for\\r\\n     pay.\\r\\n  Then were the judgments loosened; then was your shame revealed,\\r\\n  At the hands of a little people, few but apt in the field.\\r\\n  Yet ye were saved by a remnant (and your land\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-suffering Star),\\r\\n  When your strong men cheered in their millions while your striplings\\r\\n     went to the war.\\r\\n  Sons of the sheltered city--unmade, unhandled, unmeet--\\r\\n  Ye pushed them raw to the battle as ye picked them raw from the\\r\\n     street.\\r\\n  And what did ye look they should compass? War-craft learned in a\\r\\n     breath,\\r\\n  Knowledge unto occasion at the first far view of Death?\\r\\n  So! And ye train your horses and the dogs ye feed and prize?\\r\\n  How are the beasts more worthy than the souls your sacrifice?\\r\\n  But ye said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Their valour shall show them\\xe2\\x80\\x99; but ye said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98The end is\\r\\n     close.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n  And ye sent them comfits and pictures to help them harry your foes,\\r\\n  And ye vaunted your fathomless power, and ye flaunted your iron pride,\\r\\n  Ere--ye fawned on the Younger Nations for the men who could shoot and\\r\\n     ride!\\r\\n  Then ye returned to your trinkets; then ye contented your souls\\r\\n  With the flannelled fools at the wicket or the muddied oafs at the\\r\\n     goals.\\r\\n  Given to strong delusion, wholly believing a lie,\\r\\n  Ye saw that the land lay fenceless, and ye let the months go by\\r\\n  Waiting some easy wonder: hoping some saving sign--\\r\\n  Idle--openly idle--in the lee of the forespent Line.\\r\\n  Idle--except for your boasting--and what is your boasting worth\\r\\n  If ye grudge a year of service to the lordliest life on earth?\\r\\n  Ancient, effortless, ordered, cycle on cycle set,\\r\\n  Life so long untroubled, that ye who inherit forget\\r\\n  It was not made with the mountains, it is not one with the deep.\\r\\n  Men, not gods, devised it.

the body\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ease;\\r\\n  Proud little brazen Baals and talking fetishes;\\r\\n  Teraphs of sept and party and wise wood-pavement gods--\\r\\n  _These_ shall come down to the battle and snatch you from under the\\r\\n     rods?\\r\\n  From the gusty, flickering gun-roll with viewless salvoes rent,\\r\\n  And the pitted hail of the bullets that tell not whence they were\\r\\n     sent.\\r\\n  When ye are ringed as with iron, when ye are scourged as with whips,\\r\\n  When the meat is yet in your belly, and the boast is yet on your\\r\\n     lips;\\r\\n  When ye go forth at morning and the noon beholds you broke,\\r\\n  Ere ye lie down at even, your remnant, under the yoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _No doubt but ye are the People--absolute, strong, and wise;\\r\\n  Whatever your

40]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Word came down to Dives in Torment where he lay:\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Our World is full of wickedness, My Children maim and slay,\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98And the Saint and Seer and Prophet\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98Can make no better of it\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Than to sanctify and prophesy and pray.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Rise up, rise up, thou Dives, and take again thy gold,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98And thy women and thy housen as they were to thee of old.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98It may be grace hath found thee\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98In the furnace where We bound thee,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98And that thou shalt bring the peace My Son foretold.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n  Then merrily rose Dives and leaped from out his fire,\\r\\n  And walked abroad with diligence to do the Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire;\\r\\n    And anon the battles ceased,\\r\\n    And the captives were released,\\r\\n  And Earth had rest from Goshen to Gadire.\\r\\n\\r\\n  The Word came down to Satan that raged and roared alone,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x99Mid the shouting of the peoples by the cannon overthrown\\r\\n    (But the Prophets, Saints, and Seers\\r\\n    Set each other by the ears,\\r\\n  For each would claim the marvel as his own):\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Rise up, rise up, thou Satan, upon the Earth to go,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98And prove the peace of Dives if it be good or no:\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98For all that he hath planned\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98We deliver to thy hand,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98As thy skill shall serve to break it or bring low.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n  Then mightily rose Satan, and about the Earth he hied,\\r\\n  And breathed on Kings in idleness and Princes drunk with pride;\\r\\n    But for all the wrong he breathed\\r\\n    There was never sword unsheathed,\\r\\n  And the fires he lighted flickered out and died.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Then terribly rose Satan, and he darkened Earth afar,\\r\\n  Till he came on cunning Dives where the money-changers are;\\r\\n    And he saw men pledge their gear\\r\\n    For the gold that buys the spear,\\r\\n  And the helmet and the habergeon of war.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Yea to Dives came the Persian and the Syrian and the Mede--\\r\\n  And their hearts were nothing altered, nor their cunning nor their\\r\\n       greed--\\r\\n    And they pledged their flocks and farms\\r\\n    For the king-compelling arms,\\r\\n  And Dives lent according to their need.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Then Satan said to Dives:--\\xe2\\x80\\x99Return again with me,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Who hast broken His Commandment in the day He set thee free,\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98Who grindest for thy greed,\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98Man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s belly-pinch and need;\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98And the blood of Man to filthy usury!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n  Then softly answered Dives where the money-changers sit:--\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98My refuge is Our Master, O My Master in the Pit;\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98But behold all Earth is laid\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98In the peace which I have made,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98And behold I wait on thee to trouble it!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n  Then angrily turned Satan, and about the Seas he fled,\\r\\n  To shake the new-sown peoples with insult, doubt, and dread;\\r\\n    But for all the sleight he used\\r\\n    There was never squadron loosed,\\r\\n  And the brands he flung flew dying and fell dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Yet to Dives came Atlantis and the Captains of the West--\\r\\n  And their hates were nothing weakened nor their anger nor unrest--\\r\\n    And they pawned their utmost trade\\r\\n    For the dry, decreeing blade;\\r\\n  And Dives lent and took of them their best.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Then Satan said to Dives:--\\xe2\\x80\\x99Declare thou by The Name,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98The secret of thy subtlety that turneth mine to shame.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98It is known through all the Hells\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98How my peoples mocked my spells,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98And my faithless Kings denied me ere I came.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n  Then answered cunning Dives: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Do not gold and hate abide\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98At the heart of every Magic, yea, and senseless fear beside?\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98With gold and fear and hate\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98I have harnessed state to state,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98And with hate and fear and gold their hates are tied.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98For hate men seek a weapon, for fear they seek a shield--\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Keener blades and broader targes than their frantic neighbours\\r\\n       wield--\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98For gold I arm their hands,\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98And for gold I buy their lands,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98And for gold I sell their enemies the yield.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Their nearest foes may purchase, or their furthest friends may\\r\\n       lease,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98One by one from Ancient Accad to the Islands of the Seas.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98And their covenants they make\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98For the naked iron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98But I--I trap them armoured into peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98The flocks that Egypt pledged me to Assyria I drave,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98And Pharaoh hath the increase of the herds that Sargon gave.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98Not for Ashdod overthrown\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98Will the Kings destroy their own,\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Or their peoples wake the strife they feign to brave.\\r\\n\\r\\n

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\r\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\r\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\r\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\r\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\r\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\r\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n"
